
# The Arcanist Class Mod

## How to Install

Simply copy each of the folder into the DarkestDungeon game folder (usually here  C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DarkestDungeon\)
This should copy over and add some files to each of the folder.  See below for instruction how to add the Effects and Localization.

It would also be a good idea to back up some files before hand.


## Game Updates

Currently, if the game updates, sometime it would wipe out some of the files need for this mod. Usually, this require re-copy of the Effects and run the Localization again.  



## Localization

Go to the localization fold (usually here  C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DarkestDungeon\localization\)
Make sure the  [this hero name].string_table file is in that folder.  Run the Localization.bat file, and it will compile the table.
